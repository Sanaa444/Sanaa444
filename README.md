 Iâ€™m Sanaa Jerry aka @Sanaa444

My portfolio is a representation of the research and studies I have conducted as a Computer Science student. In this electronic portfolio, you will find work and school related projects, pictures, and notes to exemplify the research I have conducted during my time spent in Class CIS 0835.


My name is Sanaa Jerry. I am a freshman at Temple University, Originally from Stratford, Connecticut. This spring I will be finishing my first year of college. My wish is to take the knowledge I have learned and help open after school coding programs for kids growing up in low income communities.  

 I spend the majority of my time working, I have worked at Code Ninjas South Philadelphia, Trumbull, and Fairfield. when I am not teaching class, I am outside exploring, out with friends/roommates, or I am volunteering at local libraries. I enjoy fighting for social justice and change as well.

In 2019 I began a student led non-profit group named Change By Teens, Together we held fundraisers to spread awareness and social change, the money we raised was donated to small organizations such as the Connecticut Bail Fund and the Norwalk Triangle Center. In previous years I have had the honor of working for senator of Bridgeport Ct, Marilyn Moore's campaign

One of my favorite hobbies is sewing, I have been sewing for about 7 years now. I have helped design quilts for the local libraries back at home, museums, and I have even been featured in the quilt folk magazine last year.
